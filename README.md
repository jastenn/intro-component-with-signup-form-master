## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about vuejs with this challenge, I learn to write a cleaner and more readable template in vue when dealing with form. And on how to integrate vuelidate with vue3's composition api.

### Continued development

Using css variables that depends on another one another helps me manage those a little bit better. And I would continue to write a cleaner template by keeping utilizing some built in methods and by keeping my components small.

### Useful resources

- [Vuelidate Docs](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) - This helps me learn to use vuelidate
